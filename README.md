# Ship 0 — Node/JS (LocalStorage Ship Log)

**Purpose:** Minimal hands-on check that Node is installed and you can ship something small.

## What you’ll build
A single-file web app that stores entries in **localStorage** and renders them newest-first.

## Prereqs
- Node **18+** (`node -v`)
- A browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Edge)

## Quick start
1) Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or `open index.html` / `xdg-open index.html` / `start index.html`).  
   _Optional_: run a static server instead: `npx http-server .` then open the shown URL.
2) Type a couple entries → **Add** → refresh the page. Entries should persist.

## Pass criteria
- You can add entries and they **persist** after refresh (localStorage).
- Add a screenshot at `public/screenshot.png` (or include in README).
- **≥2 commits** (not one giant dump).
- Repo name is exactly: `edge-f25-ship0-<onyen-or-last-first>`.

## Submit
Paste your repo URL + screenshot in the Ship 0 submission form from the Kickoff Pack.

### Notes
This template deliberately avoids bundlers and frameworks to keep the first ship fast.
